# Cinnamon Cinema Kata 
## Created in Java using a Test Driven Development (TDD) Approach
The movie theatre has three rows (A, B, C) of five seats (1,2,3,4,5).  

Methods ensure that a user can select a number of seats from 1-3.  Seats are filled from front to back (A to C) left to right (1 to 5).
The application will allocate seats (randomly from 1 to 3) until all the seats are taken. 

### How to run the application
To run this application, start the main method from Main class.  This will randomly assign seats until the cinema is full.
This is shown via command line displaying a coloured grid of the seats at each stage they are assigned.

## Future Considerations
This application can be expanded to do the following:
* User Interface to allow users to type in/select the number of seats required
* Have a bigger sized theatre (e.g. more rows or more seats per row or even varying numbers per row)
* Have seats assigned to individual movies/show times
* Add ticket objects for users
